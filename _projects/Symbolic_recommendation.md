title: Recommendation using Neuro Symbolic approches
description: Implemented three Neuro-Symbolic Machine Learning approaches for product recommendation based on user purchase history. First, the Apriori algorithm was utilized to identify frequently co-purchased items, which were then used to augment the training data. Next, aggregated contrastive loss was employed to differentiate between a userâ€™s positive and negative reviews. Finally, an architectural adjustment was introduced by leveraging a hierarchical prediction method using the masking concept.
