title: Community Posting App
description: Developed a "Community Posting App" server using Ktor and an H2 in-memory database via the Exposed library. Supported routes for retrieving, creating, and deleting posts by ID, viewing posts since a timestamp, and fetching all posts. Used a phased approach with initial HashMap-based routing, later integrating persistent storage. Manually tested HTTP requests to ensure functionality.
tech_stack: Kotlin, Ktor, H2
