title: SubGIN - Subgraph Isomorphism Detection using Graph Neural Networks
description: Designed a neural network architecture, in which, we proposed an attention-based graph pooling mechanism and an Interactive context attention layer. Applied CNN on derived feature matrices to learn node level similarity and Neural Tensor Network on graph embeddings to study their global relation. Evaluated the model on various graph datasets
tech_stack: Python, Pytorch, networkx
