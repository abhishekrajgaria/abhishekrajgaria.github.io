Hi there, Currently I am pursuing a MS in Computer Science from the [University of Utah, Salt Lake City](https://www.utah.edu/). My Interest lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and aims to create applications which involves engineering with the help of these technologies.

In Summer 24, I worked with [Dr Vivek Gupta](https://vgupta123.github.io/) on the topic Reasoning using LLMs on Complex data. There we created a Map based QA benchmark for Large Vision-Langauage models. I am also working with him on creating a dynamic prompting technique that could address multiple Tabular QA tasks.

Before this, I spent around 2 years working as a Software Development Engineer at [Publicis Sapient, India](https://www.publicissapient.com/), during this time I worked on 3 different platforms ranging from E-commerce, Neo Banking, Teaching Platforms, in an Agile environment following the latest industry practices such as Micro-service, Micro-frontend Framework, DevOps cycle for code publishing.

I completed my undergraduate studies with honors, from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), majoring in [Computer Science with Applied Mathematics](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/btech).There, I got the chance to work with [Dr Vikram Goyal](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~vikram/) for my Bachelor Thesis on "Graph Neural Network for Subgraph Isomorphism Detection", [Dr Debajyoti Bera](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~dbera/) and [Sagnik Chatterjee](http://chatsagnik.com/) on "Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on Graph Matching and Max Cut Problems". Interned with [Dr Sanjit Kaul](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjitkkaul/) on "Autonomous Vehicle Project - [Swarath](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjitkkaul/sponsored-projects?authuser=0#h.p_JujlhcndA8LM)".

Areas of Experience - Software Engineering, Full-Stack Developer, Back-end Developer, Front-end Developer, Devops, Student Mentor, AI-Topics Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and working with LLMs
